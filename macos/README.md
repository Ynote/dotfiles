# Basic install

## Install Homebrew

Type this command in your terminal:
```sh
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Sometimes:
- Homebrew needs Xcode, you may need to install it,
- You may encounter a compatibility issue between your Xcode current version and
  your OS current version. In this case, update your OS to the last version and
  try the Homebrew install again,
